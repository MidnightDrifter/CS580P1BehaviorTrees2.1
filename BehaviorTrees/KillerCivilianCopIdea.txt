Basic AI idea:   have 3 characters:  Police, Killer, Civilian

Killer tries to kill X number of people
Will try to kill a certain person 3 times, then give up and change targets
Civilians notice death--nearest few?  Random few?--then flee randomly, broadcasting to police for a time--3s?  Maybe add in random chance to simply panic WITHOUT alerting police
Police will try to chase, then make an arrest to the nearest person--if civilian, both the cop and civilian are frozen for a time.
Repeat until Killer caught or he has killed his quota
Totally not a Party Hard ripoff thing


Cop = Blue, Killer = Red, Civ = Green?   Victory = Yellow-Gold, Defeat = Black
